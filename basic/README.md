Concept warm-ups that ease MATLAB users into Python’s scientific stack.

## Notebooks
- `scientific_abstraction_levels.ipynb` – Why abstraction layers matter when refactoring analytic code.
- `abstraction_levels_finance_example.ipynb` – Finance-themed walkthrough applying those layers step by step.
- `matlab_to_python_ultimate_guide.ipynb` – Talking points and side-by-side translations to sell the switch.

## Run Tips
Execute cells sequentially; installation cells are embedded where needed. These notebooks are light-weight and run fine on CPU-only laptops.
