Vector and raster GIS essentials for analysts leaving ArcGIS/QGIS scripting behind.

## Notebooks
- `rasterio_tutorial.ipynb` – Read/write rasters, windowed IO, and CRS handling with Rasterio.
- `vector_tutorial.ipynb` – GeoPandas-style vector operations, joins, and plotting recipes.

## Run Tips
These require GDAL-linked packages; use conda-forge if pip wheels fail on your platform.
